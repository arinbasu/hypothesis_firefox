# hypothesis_firefox
This is a port for hypothesis chrome extension to work with firefox browser. While hypothesis works for firefox, it is better integrated with Google chrome and chromium based browsers. If we can tweak some of the codes and make it work, can we work with hypothesis in the same way we interact with it using Google Chrome? This is the basis of this experiment. If you want to help in improving the code, please let me know.
